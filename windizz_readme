HOW TO BUILD WINDIZZ

* Clone the csfx repo into loader/csfx
* Clone the dizzy repo into perl_code
* Extract the Strawberry Portable archive into strawberry
  (optionally removing some large files in it that are not needed for running
  dizzy. For example, the C compilers, the POD, the perl headers, Unicode
  character tables, MySQL libraries, ...)
* Build Convert::Color and OpenGL and copy the contents of their blib
  directories into support_libraries
* put freeglut.dll from OpenGL to the same directory where OpenGL.dll is located
* build loader/setup/Loader.dpr using Delphi.
* Create a tarball of the contents of the top level directory (so that when
  extracting it, four directories would show up in the working directory).
  Move the tarball to loader/csfx/windizz.tar
* Copy sfxdata.rc to loader/csfx
* Build csfx using make.
* run UPX on csfx.exe
